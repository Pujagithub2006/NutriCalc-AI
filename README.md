# 🔷 NutriCalc AI – Culture-Aware Nutrition Intelligence Platform

## Project Overview
NutriCalc AI is an AI-powered, culture-aware nutrition and health application designed to make food tracking easier, smarter, and more relevant for real-world lifestyles. Unlike traditional calorie tracking apps, this platform focuses on home-cooked meals, cultural food habits, offline accessibility, and personalized health insights.

## Problem Statement
Most existing nutrition apps are designed for Western-style diets, pre-packaged meals, and constant internet access. They require manual logging and do not accurately support home-cooked or culturally diverse food habits. This makes them difficult to use and ineffective for a large part of the population.

## Goals
- Build an AI-driven food logging system that requires minimal manual effort.
- Provide culturally intelligent nutrition guidance.
- Generate predictive health insights using food, activity, and symptom data.
- Ensure the app works offline while maintaining user privacy.

## Objectives
- Develop multi-modal food logging using image, video, voice, and text.
- Estimate portion size and nutrients automatically.
- Create a cultural context engine for accurate food analysis.
- Implement a predictive system linking diet, activity, and symptoms.
- Build a conversational assistant using RAG for nutrition-related queries.
- Enable offline AI processing for low latency and privacy.
- Follow a freemium model with advanced features as premium.

## Deliverables
- Cross-platform mobile application (Android & iOS).
- On-device AI models for food recognition and nutrition estimation.
- Backend system for data synchronization and user management.
- Admin dashboard for monitoring and analytics.
- Technical documentation and API specifications.
